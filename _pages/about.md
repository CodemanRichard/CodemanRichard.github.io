Hello there ðŸ‘‹This is Tianrui Zhang, an undergraduate student majoring computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

About myself
======
My interests are mostly web development. I'm a Django contributor and has made some toy projects in this direction. Apart from web, I'm also good at AI, from CNN to LLM, from training a model to building a debugging agent with the help of LLM.

Maybe some more?
======
Yeah I'm new to personal homepage development and am still wondering what information I should add here :) The top bars need some update, too.
