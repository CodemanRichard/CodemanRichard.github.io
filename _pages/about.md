About myself
======
My interests are mostly web development. I have comprehensive experience in backend, frontend and mobile application development.

My main focus is backend development. I like building robust backend service with Java or Python. I've made some cool projects using Flask, Django and Spring Boot. Apart from these major frameworks, I'm also familiar with databases like MySQL and Redis, and distributed system's components like Kafka and Spring Cloud.
